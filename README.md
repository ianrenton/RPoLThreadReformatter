RPoL Thread Reformatter
=======================

This script takes a downloaded thread from [RPoL](http://www.rpol.net), and reformats it into something reasonably tidy for importing elsewhere.

Written in Python 2.5, doesn't require any external libraries.  To use it, find an RPoL thread, click "D/L" at the top right.  Keep the default options, and request the download.  Take the page it produces and save it (File > Save As... or whatever) in the same directory as the script as input.html.  The script will produce an output.txt (it's not a full HTML page, hence TXT not HTML).

Use at your own risk, may destroy the universe amongst other symptoms.
